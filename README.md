## What this is

A custom-built internal tool replacing ClickUp and Notion for the AB Capital team. It includes:

- **Task tracker** — create and manage tasks across spaces, folders, and subfolders with list and board views
- **Wiki** — internal knowledge base for document checklists, process guides, and SOPs
- **Team login** — each team member has their own account and sees only their assigned tasks
- **Custom fields** — each space can have its own fields (e.g. TRN, Passport No., Trade License)
- **Custom statuses** — each space can have its own workflow statuses (e.g. Client Discontinued)
- **My Tasks** — personal view showing all tasks assigned to the logged-in user
- **Dashboard** — overview of all tasks, spaces, and completion metrics
